! Tips

!! Organic navigation

* In `locator-tags`, look for a tag and apply it as an ancestor tag; the `locator-search` only affects tiddlers associated with it at any depth
* Click on the tag in `locator-tags` and open its tiddler, then click on the "locator sidebar" button; the `locator-view` sidebar will show it's hierarchy
* Navigate in the hierarchy of `locator-view` sidebar then search for a term in `locator-search`; pressing the "copy context" button restricting the search to the context of `locator-view` sidebar
* If you cannot find what you are searching for, then you may want to create a new tiddler, use the "new tiddler" button in one of the Locator macros

!! Speed up (on phones)

!!! Conditional view

Because ''the plugin could be slow if `kin` filter is used'' (depending on the context) and since we don't look at the table of contents and search results at the same time, we can ''hide the Locator while we are using the standard search''.

To achieve this, place the Locator view in the following condition:

```
<$reveal type="match" default="" text={{{ [prefix[$:/state/popup/search-dropdown]] }}}>
<<locator-view "TableOfContents">>
</$reveal>
```

''When you open TiddlyWiki'', the search entry is in focus by default, so ''the Locator sidebar is not visible''. To fix this, change the text of [[$:/config/Search/AutoFocus]] [[hidden setting|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Hidden%20Setting%3A%20Search%20AutoFocus]] to `false`.

!!! Prefer the standard search

''Typing in the search entry could be slow'' because of the slowness of the `kin` filter (depending on the context). In this case, ''switch to the classic search listing'', enter the expression, and then return to the Locator search.

//Select the next tab to continue.//
