! Usage of `locator-tags` (customised search results for tags)

@@.bimlas-locator-warning.bimlas-locator-explanation
Filtering by ancestor tags ({{$:/core/images/link}}) requires the `kin` filter operator, filtering by direct tags ({{$:/core/images/tag-button}}) works without it!
@@

Take the same steps you did for `locator-search`, but use this code:

```
<<locator-tags>>
```

''Search for tags instead of tiddler titles'', the list of tags is structured as follows:

<div class="tc-tiddler-frame bimlas-locator-explanation">
{{$:/core/images/new-button}} {{$:/core/images/close-others-button}} {{$:/core/images/advanced-search-button}} {{$:/core/images/close-button}} <br/>
<$list filter="123" variable="resultCount" template="$:/language/Search/Matches"/><br/>
{{$:/core/images/link}} <<tag-pill "Breadcrumb tag pills">><br/>
<hr/>
//Title matches//<br/>
{{$:/core/images/link}} {{$:/core/images/tag-button}} <<tag-pill "Tags with matching titles">><br/>
//Related tags//<br/>
{{$:/core/images/link}} {{$:/core/images/tag-button}} <<tag-pill "Tags of search results...">><br/>
{{$:/core/images/link}} {{$:/core/images/tag-button}} <<tag-pill "...expect breadcrumbs...">><br/>
{{$:/core/images/link}} {{$:/core/images/tag-button}} <<tag-pill "...and listed titles">><br/>
</div>

* {{$:/core/images/new-button}}: Create a new tiddler with the currently selected tags whose default name will be the search text
* {{$:/core/images/close-button}}: Clear tag filters, search everywhere
* {{$:/core/images/close-others-button}}: Restrict the search to the context of the Locator sidebar
* {{$:/core/images/advanced-search-button}}: Copy the filter (including tags) to [[$:/AdvancedSearch]] to perform additional filtering
* {{$:/core/images/link}}: Look for the search term under this tag at any depth (this ancestor tag is broadly defining the topic of the search)
* {{$:/core/images/tag-button}}: Look for the search term in tiddlers directly tagged by this tag (direct tag)

The picked tags using to ''narrow the scope of `locator-search`'', clicking on the the tag itself shows the titles associated with this tag (usual tag-dropdown). The number of the matching tiddlers is shown on the top so you don't have to switch back and forth between `locator-search` and `locator-tags` tabs to see to see if you've narrowed down the list enough.

''NOTE'': If you want to ''get all results related to the selected tags'', replace the search text with spaces, otherwise only those tiddlers will be listed which contains the text (for example a tiddler deeply in the TableOfContents does not contains the TableOfContents text).

//Select the next tab to continue.//
