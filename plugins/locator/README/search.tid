The macro can be used to ''search only in the context defined by `locator-view` or `locator-tags`''.

* Add a `locator-view` to the sidebar as described above
* Create a new tiddler
* Add the [[$:/tags/SearchResults]] tag
* Add the `caption` field to change the title of the tab
* Place this code in tiddler:

```
<<locator-search>>
```

@@.bimlas-locator-explanation
If you type something in the standard search, you can see the newly created tiddler as a new tab in the search results. Use the {{$:/core/images/close-others-button}} button to ''restrict the search to the context of the Locator sidebar'' by copying its breadcrumbs. Adding additional tags is possible in `locator-tags`.
