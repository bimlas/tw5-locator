This is the demo of the Locator [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com/]] plugin. Here you can try everything what is in the plugin description.

In the sidebar Locator you can discover the contents of this wiki, which contains the [[Family tree of Ford]] and [[Larry's Cookbook]].

You can also copy Locator tiddlers to your own wiki by dragging the following titles:

</$list>
