title: Roasted Brussel Sprouts
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

"Brussels sprouts are simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil, then slow-roasted in a very hot oven until darkest brown. They are the perfect combination of sweet and salty, and make for perfect snack leftovers straight from the fridge the next day!"

!! Ingredients
 * 1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, ends
trimmed and yellow leaves removed
*3 tablespoons olive oil
*1 teaspoon kosher salt
*1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black
pepper

!! Instructions
#Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
#Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.
#Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.
